My personal website, and single page that includes the following sections: Home, About, Portfolio, Contact, Networks.


Upcoming planning

Make new nav bar (This one kind of sucks, too big for the stuff on it) and have it so that it hide when scrolling down (on mobile only if the bar is a nice size), also add it so that it's postion is dynamic (the thing I did with weather portal)

Projects

    APP - Food scanner

    Figure out to link games? 

Networks

    (Make it so that when you hover over a link, the assocated image(svg) fills with color (linked in logo turns blue, github logo git red, youtube logo turns red) and have it for the email logo the it tranforst into a mail tilted about 45 degrees with fast lines (could be an animation))
